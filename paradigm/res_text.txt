Kubernetes (/ˌk(j)uːbərˈnɛtɪs, -ˈneɪtɪs, -ˈneɪtiːz/, commonly stylized as K8s[4]) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.[5]

It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts".[6] It works with a range of container tools and runs containers in a cluster, often with images built using Docker. Kubernetes originally interfaced with the Docker runtime[7] through a "Dockershim"; however, the shim has since been deprecated in favor of directly interfacing with containerd or another CRI-compliant runtime.[8]

Many cloud services offer a Kubernetes-based platform or infrastructure as a service (PaaS or IaaS) on which Kubernetes can be deployed as a platform-providing service. Many vendors also provide their own branded Kubernetes distributions.
Kubernetes defines a set of building blocks ("primitives"), which collectively provide mechanisms that deploy, maintain, and scale applications based on CPU, memory[24] or custom metrics.[25] Kubernetes is loosely coupled and extensible to meet different workloads. This extensibility is provided in large part by the Kubernetes API, which is used by internal components as well as extensions and containers that run on Kubernetes.[26] The platform exerts its control over compute and storage resources by defining resources as Objects, which can then be managed as such.

Kubernetes follows the primary/replica architecture. The components of Kubernetes can be divided into those that manage an individual node and those that are part of the control plane
